Currently pursuing Master's in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke University with quantitative finance concentration. 4 years production ML experience. Background in economics (Universidad Panamericana, 8.68 GPA) with specialized coursework in stochastic calculus and econometrics.

**Research Interests:** Portfolio optimization, regime detection, market microstructure, econometric modeling

## Selected Projects

### [Advanced Portfolio Optimization Suite](https://github.com/isaacvm98/portfolio-optimization)
Complete implementation of multiple portfolio strategies with regime detection using Hidden Markov Models. Includes Markowitz mean-variance, Black-Litterman with investor views, risk parity, and VaR optimization. Production-ready backtesting framework with transaction cost modeling.

**Key Components:**
- 11 distinct optimization strategies
- HMM-based regime detection (bull/bear market identification)  
- Realistic transaction costs and market impact modeling
- Comprehensive performance attribution and risk decomposition

**Technologies:** Python, CVXPY, HMMlearn, PyPortfolioOpt, NumPy/SciPy

### Stochastic Calculus Implementation
Black-Scholes pricing engine with Greeks calculation and Monte Carlo simulation for path-dependent options. Includes Heston stochastic volatility model and numerical methods for American option pricing.

**Methods:** Ito calculus, finite difference schemes, variance reduction techniques
**Applications:** Market making, risk management, derivatives trading

### [NCAA Tournament Prediction (Top 1%)](https://github.com/isaacvm98/march-madness)
Achieved 12th place out of 1,200 teams in Kaggle competition using ensemble methods. Combined XGBoost with generalized linear mixed effects models to handle hierarchical tournament structure.

**Statistical Methods:** Bayesian hierarchical modeling, uncertainty quantification, ensemble learning
**Results:** Consistent top percentile performance across multiple competition years

### Spatial Econometrics Research
Analysis of poverty-crime relationships across Mexico's 32 states using spatial lag models. Incorporated geographic dependencies through contiguity-based weight matrices and Moran's I statistics.

**Supervision:** Dr. Jose Miguel Torres, Universidad Panamericana
**Methods:** Spatial autocorrelation, robustness testing, policy analysis
