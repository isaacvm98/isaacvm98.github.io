# About Me

I'm a Data Scientist with a unique blend of economic theory and machine learning expertise. My journey in data science began during my economics studies at Universidad Panamericana, where I discovered my passion for using data to solve complex business problems.

## Professional Journey

Currently working as a Semi Sr. Data Scientist at Enable Global, I focus on developing data science solutions for Operational Technology (OT) challenges. My work involves everything from analyzing steel manufacturing processes to building automated data quality systems.

Previously at Entropia AI, I specialized in implementing state-of-the-art models and creating end-to-end data science solutions. One of my proudest achievements was developing a production-ready Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model, translating complex economic theory into practical business applications.
